      <h3 class="mission-head">Millennial <br> Meals <br> Mission</h3>
      <p class="mission-para">Do you find it difficult to make tasty, healthy meals every day?
        Our fast pace world can make it hard to make delicious meals for you, your family, or your roommates. My
        website, Millenial Meals, was inspired by my sister who recently finished college and became a mother to twins.
        Trying to balance their schedule and making healthy meals was difficult until she found recipes that made
        delicous meals quickly. She wanted a platform to share these meals and for others to share their favorite
        recipes.</p>
      <h3 class="demo-head">Demographics <br> for our <br> Meals</h3>
      <p class="demo-para">My website focuses on college students, newly weds, and new parents. Trying to balance
        school, work, relationships, children, and chores is challenging for many especially when you need to provide
        meals. It is so easy to grab a
        meal at a Fast Food restaurant, but this becomes expensive and is unhealthy. Providing healthier and easy meals
        for college students, new couples, and new parents is our goal. We hope this will help create better habits to
        make you happier and healthier.</p>
      <h3 class="time-head">Time <br> of our <br> recipes</h3>
      <p class="time-para">Our goal is to provide recipes that can be made and cooked in an hour or less. The majority
        of our recipes use easy-to-find ingredients and simple cooking methods. Some of these
        recipes do require a crockpot, so while the preparing is quick, the cooking may be a few hours. I
        included these recipes since they're easy to prepare even if it takes longer to cook.
        If you wish to do these crockpot recipes, plan on
        preparing the recipe in the morning, cook it all day, and eat when you are ready.</p>
