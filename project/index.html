            <p class="home-paragraph-1">We believe that there is nothing like a river trip for relaxing. That is why we
                subscribe to the dry oar
                philosophy of boating. Keeping your oars dry for us means taking time to look around and notice the
                beauty that surrounds the rivers we love.</p>

            <p class="home-paragraph-2">That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all things after all.
                We believe that that
                tenseness that comes when you are looking down the tongue of a big string of waves makes you appreciate
                the calm beautiful water that always follows even more.</p>
