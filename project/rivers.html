                <p class="river-1-paragraph">Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon
                river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it
                because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the
                river that they never left. <br> Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and
                bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa
                pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when
                needed. <br> Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of
                the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster,
                and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids
                all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower,
                warmer water more.</p>

                <p class="river-2-paragraph">Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land
                    anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone
                    cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs
                    from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery,
                    interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great
                    whitewater opportunities. <br> Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days <br> Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This
                    designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.</p>

                        river trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon. <br> Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with
                        breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not
                        only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins
                        accessible only by river.<br> CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The
                        rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of
                        rapids and river variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river
                        rating scale, so we often refer to both.</p>
